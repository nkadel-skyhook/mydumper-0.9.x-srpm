Tools to build mydumpre 0.9.x SRPM

mydumper is published by Percona, and is available as binary RPMs from
them. I've been unable to download SRPMs for that. Versions have been
published by Remi Colletee and by LenzGr on the OpenSuSE project, and
I've based this port on LenGr's work at:

* http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/LenzGr/SLE_11/src/

To build RPMs locally, use:

* make build

To build with mock, use:

* make
